## Abstract
Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is common in individuals with Parkinson’s Disease (PD). Early signs in PD are indicative of the potential development of Parkinson’s Disease Dementia (PDD). This study aims to use video gaming as a neuropsychological test to evaluate cognitive impairment in PD that is comparable (or superior) to traditional modalities. Traditional screenings are time-consuming and disengaging. Preliminary research indicates video gaming has the potential to analyze cognitive function by increasing efficiency and patient interest. A computerized test, or “video gaming” with the capability to test 5 cognitive performance domains will be used to measure MCI in PD. 90 participants will be evaluated: 60 PD (30 with MCI and 30 without MCI) and 30 non-PD. Participants will be assessed using both traditional and videogame modalities. The results of the traditional MCI screenings will be compared to the results of the video gaming test using an ANOVA and a T-test. Analysis of cognitive impairment with video gaming presents an effective tool for future clinical examinations to detect early signs of MCI in individuals with PD. This tool will help providers use early interventions to ease the degenerative effects of PD. - Kyle Carey

## Gameplay
Objects that the player must keep and the number of objects will be displayed at the start of the level. These objects will also be displayed during gameplay in the top-left of the screen. Objects will move from the left of the screen to the right. The player can remove objects when they enter the orange square. By doing nothing, the player will keep the object. There is infinite level progression, and levels will continue to get harder. Depending on the difficulty the player chooses, the level difficulty will stop increasing at a certain point. Every level, the types of objects to keep, the number of objects to keep, the speed, and the spawn interval will increase. There are ten types of objects. The types chosen to keep and remove are randomly chosen and are of equal amounts. The number of objects to keep and remove are also of equal amounts. When the player keeps or removes an item correctly, they will gain 25 points. Incorrectly removing an item will decrease the score by 25 points. When the player incorrectly keeps an item, they will lose 1 life. Losing 10 lives will result in a game over. The game can be played fully with keyboard or mouse/touch input. The game was developed in Unity.
